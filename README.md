# Gale-Shapley-Algorithm
As a part of my object oriented programming course, I created a program that matches suitors (students) to receivers (schools) using a Gale-Shapley algorithm
The Gale Shapley algorithm solves the famous Stable Marriage Problem (SMP). 
SMP is described as follows. Say you have a group of n men and n women, and they need to be matched
together in marriage. The men have ranked all the women in order of preference (1 is most preferred, n is
least preferred), and the women have similarly ranked all the men in order of preference. The matching
solution should make sure that each man is married to exactly one woman and vice versa, and that the
marriages are stable. A stable matching solution means that there is no one person who would rather be
with someone else who would also prefer to be with them. In other words, no two people would want to
have an aâ€‚air with each other.
